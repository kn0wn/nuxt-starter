# âš¡ nuxt-starter

This Nuxt starter is an opinionated template project with defaults setup for using firebase/firebase auth with nuxt in SPA mode.

It comes pre-installed with a couple of useful modules to help with the startup process;

- Tailwindcss (with Postcss nesting)
- DateFns
- Firebase

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
